# Visual Studio
## Import Key
When you see an error like 
    Cannot import the following key file: companyname.pfx. The key file may be password protected. To correct this, try to import the certificate again or manually install the  certificate to the Strong Name CSP with the following key container name: VS_KEY_3E185446540E7F7A
    
Then we can import the key via 
    sn -i <KeyFile> <ContainerName>

## Setup SSH Keys for Git
Following commands allow to use Git via SSH

    # Create new ssh key
    * ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "email@example.com"

    # Check if ssh-agrnt is running
    * eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

    # Add it into ssh-agent
    * ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

    # Test SSH connection to Github.com
    * ssh -T git@github.com

    # When connection times out then port is not allowed, in thic case use another port
    # Edit ~/.ssh/config and append the following
        Host github.com
        Hostname ssh.github.com
        Port 443

    # Save, exit and retry.
    ssh -T git@github.com
    # Should show now something like
    Hi powersnatch! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.

Now you can clone a repository without being asked for username and password.
